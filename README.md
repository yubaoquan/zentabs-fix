Fix Maximum open tabs bug of [zentabs](https://atom.io/packages/zentabs).

There is a bug of zentabs that when the opened tabs reach maximum open tabs, all previous tabs will be closed.

I made a [PR](https://github.com/ArnaudRinquin/atom-zentabs/pull/46) to fix this bug about a month before, but still not merged. So I open this package with the fix. This is the javascript version of zentabs.

Not quite familiar of other options in zentabs. So this package only fix the bug of `Maximun open tabs`, if there's other bugs, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/yubaoquan/zentabs-fix/issues).
